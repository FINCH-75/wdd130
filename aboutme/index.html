    <h3>NICKNAME:Chad</h3>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Chad I live in Eagar, Arizona which is in the White Mountains of Arizona. I am married with 2
    beautful children ages 3 and 1.</p> 
    <p>I currently work as a power production specialist (power plant operator) at a coal 
        burning power plant. I wish to persue a degree in computer science to better myself because the war on coal is causing 
        the plant I currently work at to close in the the next ten years.</p>
     <p>I love the outdoors particulary hunting and fishing! I also 
        love technology and video games (which is why I am persuing computer science). I look forward to learning alot this semester 
        and getting to know all of you!</p>
