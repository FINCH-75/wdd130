                            it comes to ruggedness, fishing quality, and adventure. Known by many as "The Best Smallmouth Fishery in the State,

                        The East Fork of the Black River runs from above Crescent Lake. The stretch northeast of Crescent Lake is often called
                        the North Fork of the Black River. There are Rainbow Trout, Apache Trout and Brown Trout in the east fork of the Black River,
                        so of which are stocked.
