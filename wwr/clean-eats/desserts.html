                    The keto diet focuses on limiting your carb intake, and that includes
                     how much sugar you eat. So, cakes, cookies, donuts, ice cream, and pastries
                      are all off-limits. You can still enjoy them without giving up on your weight
                       loss efforts, though, by swapping carb-heavy ingredients or cutting down on 
                       serving size of your go-to sweets. Enter keto dessert recipes. Needless to say,
                        you'll want to choose desserts that are lower in carbs and sugar and higher in 
                        fat if you want to stick to your keto lifestyle.
