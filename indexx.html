                If you’re interested in clean eating while also limiting your carbohydrates, you may have heard
                 of the keto and paleo diet. The keto and paleo diets are a diet approach that focuses on getting
                  your nutrients from fresh, unprocessed, or minimally processed foods. The thought of avoiding 
                  heavily processed foods might seem a lot of work, but eating cleaner can be easy and even better,
                   rewarding with a few helpful guidelines at your disposal.

                    The ketogenic diet, or keto diet, is a low-carb, high-fat regimen that limits carbohydrates to as 
                    low as 20 grams per day or even less. Meats, fish, eggs, most vegetables, nuts and seeds are all on
                     the menu on a keto diet, but high-carbohydrate foods like grains and white potatoes are off-limits.
                      Whether you’re interested in learning more about the keto diet or are looking for keto-approved recipes,
                       meal plans and more, you’ll find it all at Clean Tasty Eats.

                <h1>PALEO DIET</h1>

                    The popular Paleolithic diet, or paleo diet, centers on the idea that eating like our ancestors aligns
                     with our genetics and promotes good health. It’s also known as the caveman, Stone Age, or steak and bacon
                      diet. A paleo dieter’s food choices are limited to what could be hunted, fished, or gathered in prehistoric
                       times such as meats, fish, and vegetables. The theory is that the rise in chronic diseases in modern 
                       society stems from the agricultural revolution. It suggests that adding grains, legumes, and dairy to meals
                        may lead to a host of chronic diseases and conditions from obesity to allergies.
